## ✍️ How I Built This (Human-Written Code)

All code in this project was written by me, Teshera Kimbrough. I built this weather dashboard from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I manually integrated the Open-Meteo API, created a city search input, added navigation between multiple pages, and implemented a toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit without any code-generation tools.

Every function, endpoint, and visual layout was developed and tested step-by-step to strengthen my skills in frontend development and API integration.

> ✅ 100% human-coded — no AI-generated code was used in this project.
